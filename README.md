 - Create Script for Organizing Files Locally Before Upload
  - [ ] Reorganize the directories based on the following file structure
    - [ ] Certain keywords are automatically found (fansign, concert) that will programmatically rename the folder's name to `[Date]_member_type`
    - [ ] If those keywords are not found, the folder's path will be added to a text file to later rename by hand.
    - [ ] Delete any subfolders that reside inside of them (like group pictures)
  - [ ] Rename all the files inside of the folders based on the folder names (this is locally, 
    - E.g. if a file is in `./tzuyu/yes-or-yes/123456_concert`, the first image gets named `123456_1.jpg`, the second image gets named `123456_1.jpg`, and so on.
- Create Script for dealing with already uploaded files
  - [ ] Create a script to upload it to google drive, with the following requirements
     - [ ] Takes in the path of where the file was `
     - [ ] Adds metadata based on the filename e.g. `123456_concert_1.jpg` gets the tag of `date='123456'`, `type='concert'`, `member='membernamehere'`
  - [ ] Create a script (that's connected to a webserver this time), that can act like an API to query the files in the drive using the tags.
    - [ ] Script should ideally have the ability to choose a random picture if a tag is not specified e.g. `era` or `type`
